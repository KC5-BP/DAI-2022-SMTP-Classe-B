# DAI: Labo SMTP

## Brief

DAI (previously API and before RES) is a course about network programming at the HEIG-VD, 
which stands for Internet Application Development (DÃ©veloppement d'Application Internet). 

This lab will allow any user to:

- Send forged e-mails (in this case, containing jokes) to a list of victims
- Define the number of groups of victims that will receive the same e-mail
    - A group contains 1 sender and at least 2 recipients, so minimum size group is 3
- Define any message content (joke) that will be sent to victims
